Shellack
========

Shellcode creation tool

Warning - this python code is R-O-U-G-H, but it shows that you can import various files from Linux and then add them to your toolchain. The result is commented shellcode that will help when you are in need of a starting point for further development.


Additions for the future:
1. Full Android support
2. Windows support

Infinity+1. OSX support - sorry Mac, no shells for you
